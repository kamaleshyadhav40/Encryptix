                <h2>a heart-warming story worth sharing. </h2>
                <p>Vujicic was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982 to Dušanka and Borislav Vujičić, Serbian immigrants from Yugoslavia. Vujicic's father is a pastor. Vujicic was born with tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare disorder characterised by the absence of arms and legs.

                    According to Vujicic's autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him immediately after his birth; instead, she and her husband left the hospital. He was bullied at school because of his medical condition. At one point, Vujicic attempted to commit suicide by drowning himself, but he was saved. While Vujicic's parents initially struggled with grief and confusion about his condition, they "raised him to look at the bright side of life".
                    Vujicic is a Christian and an evangelist. He travels and speaks about his testimony of faith in Jesus Christ. His ministry is known as Life Without Limbs.As of 2008, the ministry was based in southern California.

                    Vujicic appeared on the ABC television show 20/20 in 2008.
                    
                    Vujicic starred in the short film The Butterfly Circus (2009).[better source needed] At the 2010 Method Fest Independent Film Festival, he was awarded Best Actor in a Short Film for his starring performance.
                    
                    Vujicic's first book, Life Without Limits: Inspiration for a Ridiculously Good Life, was published by Random House in 2010 and has been translated into 30 languages.
                    
                    Vujicic is opposed to abortion. In 2021, he co-founded ProLife Bank.
                    
                    In 2022, Vujicic launched a new ministry initiative called "Champions for the Brokenhearted". The goal of the project is to "support particular disaffected groups in need".
